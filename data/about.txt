If I could be someone,
Who could I be?
My mother, my father,
or someone who’s free.
I wish I could be someone
Whose different in all ways.
Someone whose rich or famous,
Or has those days.
If I could be someone,
I would choose to be free.
Free from rants and the paparazzi,
Choose to be filled with joy and glee.
If I could be someone,
I know exactly who to be…
Unique and different from all,
I would choose to be me.
